### Activities
Feeding & Watering: The cat owner maintains a regular schedule for feeding the cats twice a day, morning and evening.
Play & Interaction: The owner takes time to play with the cats using toys like laser pointers or strings, and spends time petting them, especially in the evening after work.
Cleaning: The owner cleans the litter box once or twice daily, ensuring a clean environment for the cats. Vacuuming to remove cat hair is part of the routine.
Travel Preparation: When traveling, the owner arranges for cat sitters or uses an automatic feeder and water dispenser. They prepare the environment for extended absence by refilling litter and ensuring the cats have access to toys.
Remote Monitoring: While traveling, the owner may check in on the cats using a pet camera or ask for updates from the sitter.
### Environment
Indoor Living Space: The cats primarily live indoors, so the environment is designed to be safe and stimulating. There are scratching posts, beds, and windows where the cats can observe the outdoors.
Home Setup: The apartment/house is organized with specific spaces for the cats (e.g., feeding corner, play area, litter box). The owner creates spaces where the cats can climb, hide, or lounge.
Work-Life Balance: During work hours, the cats either nap or entertain themselves with toys. The owner adjusts their environment to reduce distractions (e.g., giving the cats access to toys or window views to keep them occupied).
Travel Solutions: Automated feeders, cameras, and smart devices like pet fountains are part of the environment during the owner's absence, ensuring the cats’ needs are met while reducing the owner’s worry.
### Interactions
Owner-Cat Interaction: Daily interactions consist of feeding, playing, and bonding moments. The owner greets the cats after work, which becomes a familiar routine.
Owner-Object Interaction: The owner uses objects like food bowls, litter boxes, toys, and grooming tools. They regularly engage with automated devices, especially when traveling, like feeders, cameras, or litter self-cleaners.
Special Interactions: The cats might respond to certain cues from the owner, such as the sound of food containers or playtime signals (like the rustling of toy bags). The owner may have established routines, such as morning cuddles or specific times for play.
### Objects
Feeding & Watering Equipment: Food bowls, automatic feeders, and water fountains are essential. These objects are in constant use and occasionally upgraded to automated versions.
Toys: The cats have access to interactive toys (laser pointers, feather toys) and passive ones (catnip-stuffed mice, balls). Toys are used to keep the cats entertained when the owner is busy or away.
Litter Box: The litter box is regularly maintained, with tools like scoops or automatic cleaners being used.
Pet Camera & Monitoring Tools: These objects allow the owner to check on the cats remotely and offer peace of mind when traveling.
Scratching Posts & Furniture: These are frequently used by the cats for entertainment and to maintain their claws. They are strategically placed to minimize damage to furniture.
### Users
Primary User (Owner): The owner is a working professional who manages their time between work, home responsibilities, and travel. They value their cats' well-being and invest in solutions to ensure their comfort and care, even during absences.
Extreme User (Frequent Traveler): The owner’s frequent travel makes them an extreme user who relies heavily on automated systems and pet-sitting services. This user prioritizes efficient and remote solutions for pet care.
Secondary Users (Cats): The two cats are indoor pets with distinct personalities and needs. They interact with various objects (toys, furniture, litter box) and rely on the owner or automated systems for feeding and care when the owner is absent. Their behavior influences the design and use of the environment.
