### 1. What is the key issue you are trying to address, and why is it important?
The Key Issue: 

There aren’t enough automated, smart solutions to help people take care of their pets when they’re not home.

Why It’s Important:

Pet Well-being: 
Pets can get bored, lonely, or even sick when left alone for too long.
Convenience for Owners: 
Busy pet owners need help making sure their pets are fed, entertained, and safe while they’re away.
Efficiency: 
Automating things like feeding, cleaning, and playing saves time and makes sure pets are taken care of properly.

### 2. Who is it a problem for?
#### Main Group:

Pet Owners: People who have pets but struggle to balance work or travel with caring for them.

#### Other Groups:

Pet Care Providers: Vets or pet sitters who might find smart tech useful for better care.
Businesses: Companies in the pet care industry, like pet stores or tech companies.

### 3. What social or cultural factors shape this problem?
More People Have Pets: Pet ownership is increasing, and many people treat pets like family members, wanting the best care for them.

Changing Work Schedules: Many people work long hours or travel more, so they need ways to care for pets even when they’re not around.

Health and Wellness Focus: Pet owners are willing to spend money on products that improve their pets' health and happiness.

### 4. What evidence do you have that this is worth the investment?
Growing Market: The pet care industry, especially tech for pets, is growing fast, and people are spending more on their pets.

Consumer Demand: Many people are already looking for smart home gadgets that make their lives easier, and they want the same for their pets.

Current Gaps: Most smart home products focus on humans, leaving a big opportunity to develop smart products for pets.

### 5. Can you think of the problem in a different way? Can you reframe it?
From "Monitoring" to "Caring": Instead of just keeping an eye on pets, create systems that actively engage with pets to keep them happy and healthy.

From "Single Product" to "Complete System": Instead of just one gadget, think of creating a whole system that handles feeding, health, cleaning, and playing—everything in one app.

From "Owner Convenience" to "Pet Happiness": Focus on making pets happy.
