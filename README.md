# NekoFeeder - Smart NFC-Enabled Cat Feeder

# Overview
NekoFeeder is a smart, NFC-enabled cat feeder designed for multi-cat households. It ensures controlled feeding by granting access only to specific cats wearing NFC tags. This project combines Arduino for hardware control, 3D-printed components (designed in Fusion 360), and detailed system modeling through use case and activity diagrams.

*Features*

NFC Tag Integration: Each cat wears a designated NFC tag on its collar to access the feeder.

Freshness & Cleanliness: Keeps food covered to avoid contamination.
*Hardware Components*

Arduino Uno: Used to control the NFC reader, servo motors, and feeding mechanism.

NFC Module (RC522): Detects authorized NFC tags to allow specific cats access to food.

Servo Motors (SG90): Operates the feeder gate to allow food access.

3D-Printed Parts: Custom-designed housing created in Fusion 360.

*Software and Diagrams*

Arduino Code: Controls NFC scanning and interaction with the servo motors.

3D Models: Designed using Fusion 360 for the feeder housing and mechanism components.

Use Case Diagram: Outlines the interactions between the owner, cats, and feeder system.

Activity Diagram: Visualizes the feeding process, from NFC tag detection to food access.
